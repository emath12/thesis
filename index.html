      <h1>Challenging the Assumptions of<br>Scrabble Static Evaluation</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          In this thesis, I explore improvements to rule-based Scrabble heuristics. 
          Scrabble is a popular board game where players draw tiles and compete to create the most
          valuable words on a gridded board. 
          Scrabble is a fascinating game from a strategy perspective, featuring a degree of randomness 
          that hems the effectiveness of deterministic move planning 
          while still being a deeply skill based contest. 
          As the field tends more toward machine 
          learning models that fine-tune their strategy with play, 
          I seek to analyze experimentally if improvements to rule-based heuristics, 
          which use a fixed algorithm to determine which moves to play,  
          can still push the boundaries of computational Scrabble. 
          Specifically, I investigate if improvements can be made to the open source Quackle player, 
          a robust Scrabble C++ engine designed by an MIT Master's student and a Scrabble Master.
          I contend that challenging certain predetermined notions that govern 
          Quackle's current rules around its Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can lead to a more formidable AI player. 
          To do so required a rewrite
          of certain parts of the Quackle engine that made it more modularly extensible. In challenging these
          predeterminations, I uncover new heuristics that integrate more of the current state of the 
          game into the algorithm's decision making. I also discover new parameter values for the move search breadth and
          depth that led to a more effective overall Scrabble engine. 
          The style of research I applied to this particular engine
          can be replicated for similarly architected MCTS systems, which are common in games research,
          to increase their performance.
